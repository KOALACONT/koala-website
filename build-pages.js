Tell us the address and send a couple of photos of the entry and you will get an exact number." },
    { q: "How much room does the truck need?", a: "For a 20ft on a tilt-tray, roughly 20 metres of straight run-in, 3.5 metres of width at the tightest point and 4.5 metres of headroom. For a 40ft, closer to 30 metres of run-in and 4 metres of width. The truck also needs to get out again — a long driveway with nowhere to turn means reversing the whole way, and that changes the job." },
    { q: "What is the difference between a tilt-tray, a side loader and a crane truck?", a: "A tilt-tray tips its bed and slides the container off the back, so it needs the most straight room behind it and is the cheapest option. A side loader lifts the container off with its own cranes and places it beside the trailer — it needs far less length but does need clear space alongside, and it places the container off the right-hand, driver's, side. A crane truck lifts and swings, which handles sites the other two cannot reach at all, and costs the most." },
    { q: "Can the container be delivered with things already in it?", a: "Only if that was the arrangement from the start. An empty container and a loaded one are different jobs with different weights, different restraint requirements and often a different truck. Never assume a delivery quoted empty can carry a load — tell us up front and we will price it properly." },
    { q: "What if the truck cannot get in on the day?", a: "That is the outcome everybody wants to avoid, because a failed delivery still costs a truck and a driver. It is also almost entirely preventable. Send three photographs with your enquiry — one from the street looking in, one down the approach and one of the spot itself — and we will tell you before anyone quotes whether the site works and which truck it needs." },
    { q: "Do I need to prepare the ground?", a: "Usually, yes, at least a little. The container should sit level on firm ground with its weight on the four corner castings, not on soft soil in the middle. Timber sleepers, concrete pads or compacted road base under the corners is the normal answer. Ground that looks firm after a dry week can give way under two tonne per corner after a wet one." }

    <li><h3>Headroom</h3><p>Power lines, verandah edges, carport beams and — most commonly — tree branches. A tilt-tray raises its bed well above container height to unload, so the clearance needed at the moment of delivery is much greater than the height of the container sitting on the ground.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Ground bearing</h3><p>Four corner castings each carrying roughly two tonne, on whatever is underneath. Lawn over clay in the wet, river silt, fresh fill and sand all look perfectly firm and are not. If the truck sinks, the delivery stops and nobody wins.</p></li>

<p>Delivery is quoted with the container, per address. Three things move it: how far the unit has to travel, which depot it comes out of, and what the truck has to do when it gets there. That third one is the one people underestimate. Two addresses the same distance from the same depot can be a long way apart on price if one is a flat industrial entry and the other is a steep driveway with a crane job at the end of it.</p>
<p>So we work it out per job. Tell us the address, tell us what the entry looks like, and you will get a number with the cartage in it rather than a number with a delivery question mark after it. ${esc(PROMISE)}.</p>
<p class="caveat">Ground preparation is worth thinking about at the same time. A container should sit level with its weight carried on the four corner castings — timber sleepers, concrete pads or compacted road base under each corner.

What decides it is the lock and where the container sits. A lock box — a steel shroud welded over the padlock so bolt cutters cannot reach the shackle — with a closed-shackle padlock inside it is the standard answer, and it is fitted to our units. Then site it so the doors face a wall, a fence or the house rather than the street." },
    { q: "Will my things get damp in a shipping container?", a: "They can, and it is the single most under-discussed problem with container storage. It is not usually leaks — a cargo-worthy unit is checked wind and watertight. It is condensation: warm humid air inside, cold steel roof at night, and water forms on the underside of the roof and drips. Vents, a pallet layer off the floor, desiccant and not storing anything damp in the first place are the fixes." },
    { q: "Should I store a container on grass or concrete?", a: "Neither, exactly — what matters is that the weight sits on the four corner castings on something firm and level. Timber sleepers, concrete pads or compacted road base under each corner works well. Sitting the whole container flat on lawn traps moisture underneath, encourages rust from below and, on soft ground, lets one corner settle so the doors stop closing." },
    { q: "Can I store a container on my property permanently?", a: "That depends on your council, and the answer genuinely varies shire to shire. Some treat a container as an ancillary structure needing no approval; others want a siting application, particularly if it is visible from the street or is staying indefinitely. It is one phone call to your council and much better made before delivery than after." }

    <li><h3>Siting — because it decides everything else</h3><p>Level, on firm ground, weight on the four corner castings, doors facing somewhere you can get a vehicle to but a stranger cannot loiter. Fall away from the doors rather than towards them.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Air — because condensation ruins more stored goods than leaks do</h3><p>Warm humid air, cold steel, and water forms on the underside of the roof overnight and drips onto whatever is below. Vents, a pallet layer, desiccant, and never seal anything damp inside.</p></li>

Structurally sound, no holes, doors sealing properly, floor solid, and able to pass survey. It is a working standard rather than a cosmetic one, so dents, surface rust and old shipping-line paint are entirely normal on a cargo-worthy unit. Every cargo-worthy container we sell is checked wind and watertight before it leaves." },
    { q: "What does as-is mean?", a: "Retired from sea service and sold on its faults. It may have a patched repair, a soft section of floor, a door seal that no longer seats or a hole somewhere. As-is units are not sold watertight. What we will always do is tell you what is actually wrong with the specific unit and photograph it, so you buy it knowing. For plenty of jobs it is the right and much cheaper answer." },
    { q: "What is a single-trip container?", a: "A new container that has been built overseas, loaded once, shipped here and unloaded — so it has made exactly one voyage. Effectively new: straight walls, clean floor, unmarked paint, seals that have not spent years in the weather. Almost every container sold as new in Australia is a single-trip unit, because building them here does not happen at any scale." },
    { q: "Does grade affect the price more than size?", a: "Usually, yes, and that surprises people. The gap between an as-is 20ft and a new single-trip 20ft is far wider than the gap between a used 20ft and a used 40ft. It is also the gap most likely to explain why one supplier's quote looks better than another's — check you are comparing the same grade before you compare the numbers." },
    { q: "Are all your containers watertight?", a: "No, and any supplier who says all of theirs are is being loose with the word. Cargo-worthy and new units are checked wind and watertight before they leave. As-is units are explicitly not sold watertight — that is the whole reason they cost less. Which grade you need is decided by what is going inside." }

Then look at the floor for staining under the seams and at the door gasket for sections that have gone hard, flattened or torn. On a cargo-worthy unit we have already done this, but there is no substitute for looking yourself if you can." },
    { q: "What is the CSC plate?", a: "A metal plate, usually on the left-hand door, carrying the container's identification and its safety approval details for sea carriage. It tells you the container's number, when it was built and its maximum gross weight. On a unit being sold as cargo-worthy it is worth a look — a container with no plate at all is not necessarily a bad box, but it is a question worth asking." },
    { q: "What does a container number tell you?", a: "Four letters and seven digits. The first three letters are the owner code of the shipping line or leasing company that operated it, the fourth is almost always U for a freight container, and the digits are the serial and a check digit. Practically, it tells you the unit is a real ex-shipping container and gives you something specific to quote when you ring us about it." },
    { q: "Is surface rust a problem?", a: "Almost never on its own. Containers are made of Corten weathering steel, which forms a stable oxide layer and then largely stops. Surface rust on the panels is cosmetic. What matters is rust that has gone through, rust in the roof where water ponds, rust at the bottom rail where the container has sat flat on wet ground, and rust around the door frame that stops the gasket seating." }

  <ol class="steps">
    <li><h3>The floor, first and for longest</h3><p>Walk the whole length of it, heel down. You are feeling for soft spots and flex, particularly along the seams and at the door end where water gets in. Look for staining, patched sections and any repair plate. The floor is 28mm marine ply on steel cross-members and it is the single most expensive thing on a container to replace properly — which is exactly why it is worth five of the ten minutes.</p></li>
    <li><h3>The doors and the seals</h3><p>Open both doors fully and close them again. The locking bars should need a firm pull and the cams should seat. Run a hand around the rubber gasket looking for sections that have gone hard, flattened permanently or split at the corners. Most of what "wind and watertight" means in practice is happening right here.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Inside, with the doors shut</h3><p>Pull the doors to and let your eyes adjust. Any daylight is a hole. Look along the roof line, around the door frame and at the panel seams. Then look at the roof itself from inside for sagging, which means water has been ponding up there.</p></li>
    <li><h3>The roof, from outside if you can</h3><p>If it is safe to look — from a ladder, a ute tray or the next container along — check for ponding, dents that hold water and patched repairs. The roof is the thinnest steel on the container and the least visible from the ground, which is why it is where problems hide.</p></li>
    <li><h3>The frame, castings and rails</h3><p>Look at the four corner castings and the top and bottom rails. These carry every bit of load in a container and they are what a crane, a forklift and a stack all connect to. Damage here matters structurally in a way a dented side panel does not. Check the container sits square — doors that will not close on level ground usually mean a twisted frame.</p></li>
    <li><h3>The plate and the number</h3><p>Find the CSC plate on the door and note the container number. It gives you something specific to refer to, and it is a quick sanity check that the unit is what it is being described as.</p></li>

  <p><strong>Internal length is always a little less than the name.</strong> A 20ft is 6.06m outside and 5.90m inside. A 40ft is 12.19m outside and 12.03m inside.

function faqsPage() {
  const crumbs = [HOME_CRUMB, ["FAQs", "/faqs/"]];
  const groups = [
    {
      h: "Choosing a container", faqs: [
        { q: "What size shipping container do I need?", a: "Work backwards from the space, not from the stuff. A 20ft needs about seven metres of straight, level ground and is the cheapest per cubic metre most weeks. A 40ft is better value again but needs roughly thirty metres of run-in for delivery. A 10ft is the answer when the block genuinely will not take a 20ft — and it costs more per cubic metre, every time." },
        { q: "What is the difference between a standard container and a high cube?", a: "300mm of internal height and nothing else. Standard is 2.59m externally, high cube 2.90m. That extra foot is what lets you line the walls and still stand up, fit a roller door with forklift clearance, or put a mezzanine over one end. If the container is being converted rather than just filled, buy the high cube." },
        { q: "Should I buy new or used?", a: "Used, for most jobs. A cargo-worthy used unit is checked wind and watertight and costs a fraction of new. Buy new when the container will be seen — a shopfront, a front yard, a display — when it is being converted, or when it has to be reliably sealed for years rather than months." },
        { q: "How many pallets fit in a container?", a: "About 10 standard Australian pallets in a 20ft and about 21 in a 40ft, single layer. It moves with pallet size and how tightly you load. If you are working to a pallet count, say so — it is often what decides between the two sizes." }
      ]
    },
    {
      h: "Grades and condition", faqs: [
        { q: "What does cargo-worthy mean?", a: "Still certified fit to carry freight at sea — structurally sound, doors sealing, floor solid, no holes. It is a working standard, not a cosmetic one, so dents, surface rust and old shipping-line paint are normal. Every cargo-worthy unit we sell is checked wind and watertight before it leaves." },
        { q: "Are all your containers watertight?", a: "No. Cargo-worthy and new units are checked wind and watertight before they leave. As-is units are explicitly not sold watertight — that is why they cost less. Which grade you need is decided by what is going inside, and we will tell you rather than sell you up." },
        { q: "Will a container protect things in a flood?", a: "No, and nobody should tell you otherwise. A container keeps rain out from above when it is cargo-worthy grade or better. Floodwater reaches the door seals and gets in, and an empty container will float. What protects contents on a flood-prone site is height above the flood line and being able to move things out in time." },
        { q: "Is surface rust a problem?", a: "Almost never on its own. Containers are Corten weathering steel — it forms a stable oxide layer and largely stops. What matters is rust that has gone through, rust in the roof where water ponds, and rust at the bottom rail from sitting flat on wet ground." }
      ]
    },
    {
      h: "Delivery and site", faqs: [
        { q: "How much does delivery cost?", a: "It is quoted with the container, per address. Distance is only part of it — what the truck has to do at your end usually moves the figure more. We do not publish a rate because any published rate would be wrong for a good share of addresses. Send a couple of photos of the entry with your enquiry and you will get an exact number." },
        { q: "How much room does the truck need?", a: "Roughly 20 metres of straight run-in, 3.5 metres at the narrowest point and 4.5 metres of headroom for a 20ft on a tilt-tray. Closer to 30 metres of run-in and 4 metres of width for a 40ft. And the truck has to get out again, which on a long driveway means reversing the whole way." },
        { q: "Do I need to prepare the ground?", a: "Usually at least a little. The container should sit level with its weight on the four corner castings — timber sleepers, concrete pads or compacted road base under each corner. Ground that looks firm after a dry week can give way under two tonne per corner after a wet one." },
        { q: "Can the container be delivered with things in it?", a: "Only if that was the arrangement from the start. Empty and loaded are different jobs with different weights, restraint requirements and often a different truck. Tell us up front." }
      ]
    },
    {
      h: "Buying, hiring and paying", faqs: [
        { q: "Can I see the container before I buy it?", a: `Yes. Come out to the yard at ${ADDR_LINE} — ring first so we can have the units accessible. If you cannot get here, ask and we will photograph the specific unit and send it through, before delivery.` },
        { q: "When do I pay?", a: "Before the container leaves. That is standard across the industry and it is what lets us hold a specific unit for you rather than sell it out from under you. It is also exactly why we are happy to photograph it or have you inspect it first." },
        { q: "What is the minimum hire period?", a: "Usually a month, and we are flexible where it makes sense. Past roughly eighteen months to two years of continuous hire on a standard unit, buying is generally cheaper — and we will say so rather than keep billing you." },
        { q: "Do I need council approval?", a: "It depends on your council, how long it is staying and what it is used for, and it genuinely varies shire to shire. Plenty treat a container as a temporary or ancillary structure with no approval needed; others want a siting application. One phone call to your council, best made before delivery rather than after." }

Tell us what the container has to do at the enquiry rather than after it has landed." },

A corrugated steel wall is structural, so any opening cut into one has to be reframed with steel to carry the load the panel was carrying. Done properly the unit is still stackable and still moves on the same trucks. Done badly it racks, and the doors are the first thing to tell you." },
